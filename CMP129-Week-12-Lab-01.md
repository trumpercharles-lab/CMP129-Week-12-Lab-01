CMP 129 – Computer Science II
Week 12 – Lab 1: JavaFX Calculator
Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, students should be able to:

Create a graphical application using JavaFX.
Use TextField and Button controls.
Organize controls using a GridPane or VBox.
Implement button event handlers.
Store operands and arithmetic operators.
Perform basic arithmetic calculations.
Handle division-by-zero errors.
Format and display calculation results.
Assignment: Simple Calculator

Create a JavaFX calculator that allows the user to perform:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)

The calculator must include:

A display using a TextField
Digit buttons from 0 through 9
Four arithmetic operator buttons
An equals button (=)
A clear button (C)
Required Class

Create:

CalculatorApp.java

The class must extend the JavaFX Application class:

public class CalculatorApp extends Application

Include:

@Override
public void start(Stage primaryStage)

Also include a main() method that launches the application:

public static void main(String[] args) {
    launch(args);
}
Part 1: Calculator Display

Create a TextField to display:

Numbers entered by the user
Calculation results
Error messages

The display should:

Appear at the top of the calculator.
Be large enough to read easily.
Align text to the right.
Not allow the user to type directly into it.
Begin with either 0 or an empty value.

Example:

TextField display = new TextField();
display.setEditable(false);
display.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER_RIGHT);
Part 2: Calculator Buttons

Create buttons for the digits:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Create buttons for the arithmetic operators:

+ - * /

Also create:

= C

All buttons should have consistent and readable dimensions.

Part 3: Digit Event Handling

When the user clicks a digit button:

Determine which digit was selected.
Append that digit to the current display.
Allow the user to enter numbers containing multiple digits.

For example, clicking 1, 2, and 5 should display:

125

Use a shared event handler for the digit buttons instead of creating ten completely separate handlers.

Part 4: Operator Event Handling

When the user clicks an operator button:

Read the number currently displayed.
Store it as the first operand.
Store the selected operator.
Prepare the display to receive the second operand.

Suggested variables:

private double firstOperand;
private String operator;
private boolean startNewNumber;

The calculator should recognize:

+
-
*
/
Part 5: Equals Button

When the user clicks =:

Read the second operand from the display.
Determine which operator was previously selected.
Perform the correct calculation.
Display the result.
Allow the user to begin another calculation.

The operation can be selected using an if-else structure or a switch statement.

Example calculations:

12 + 8 = 20
15 - 4 = 11
6 * 7 = 42
20 / 5 = 4
Part 6: Clear Button

When the user clicks C, the calculator must:

Clear or reset the display.
Reset the first operand.
Clear the stored operator.
Prepare the calculator for a new calculation.
Part 7: Division by Zero

The calculator must not crash when division by zero is attempted.

For example:

10 / 0

The display should show:

Error: Cannot divide by zero

After displaying the error, the user should be able to press C and continue using the calculator.

Layout Requirements

Use a GridPane, VBox, or a combination of both.

A suggested arrangement is:

-------------------------
|                       |
|        Display        |
-------------------------
|   7  |   8  |   9  | / |
|   4  |   5  |   6  | * |
|   1  |   2  |   3  | - |
|   C  |   0  |   =  | + |
-------------------------

The application window should include:

A descriptive title, such as Simple Calculator
Appropriate spacing and padding
Consistently sized buttons
A readable display
A clean and organized layout
Required Test Cases

Test and demonstrate at least the following calculations:

Test	Expected result
12 + 8	20
15 - 4	11
6 * 7	42
20 / 5	4
10 / 0	Error message
Clear after a calculation	Display resets
Multiple-digit input	Digits appear in correct order
General Requirements
Use JavaFX rather than JOptionPane or a console-based interface.
Extend the JavaFX Application class.
Use a TextField for the calculator display.
Use JavaFX Button objects for all calculator controls.
Use GridPane, VBox, or both for the layout.
Implement event handlers for every button.
Use a shared handler for buttons that perform similar actions.
Support multi-digit numbers.
Implement all four required arithmetic operations.
Handle division by zero without crashing.
Keep the display read-only.
Use meaningful variable and method names.
Divide the program into organized methods when appropriate.
Include comments explaining important event-handling and calculation logic.
Follow standard Java naming and formatting conventions.
Ensure the program compiles and runs without errors.
Be prepared to explain how each event handler works.
Follow the course AI-use policy.
Record any AI assistance in AI-Use-Report.md.
Required Organization

Keep these files directly in the repository root:

- `CMP129-Week-12-Lab-01.md`
- `AI-Use-Report.md`
- `CalculatorApp.java`

Do not create or use a `src` folder.
